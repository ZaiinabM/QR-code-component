### What I learned

```css
.Barcode-img{
  border-radius: 5%;
}
.parent-container{
  border-radius: 5%;
}
body{
  width: 1440px;
}
```

### Continued development

Positioning of images with CSS; I am still not very good at Positioning images with absolute and relative positions.
Also adding margins to images or text.
I usually use hex codes for the color property, I need to learn the hsl color property and how to add fall-back background color.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://htmlcolors.com/hsl-to-hex_)- for color conversion from hsl to hex code
